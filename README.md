# Process-Scheduling-Simulator
This is a java desktop application developed using Netbeans IDE. This application will allow user to calculate parameters related to process scheduling with using various algorithms and will output which algorithm is the most efficient to use.

There are four scheduling algorithms taken into consideration which are as follows:
i) FCFS (First Come First Serve)
ii) SJF (Shortest Job First - Preemptive and Non Preemptive) 
iii) Priority Scheduling 
iv) Round‚ÄêRobin
